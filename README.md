10-17-2022 Updated the Madlib program; slimmed down the code and added a method for the play again feature

Reviewed by Isaiah Ferguson. Story was hilarious nice and readable code. the loop worked as inteded and i really like how he the ending of the loop works. I believe he needs to add data validation via Try.Parse. other than that an incredible code!
